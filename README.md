# JSDeodorant

This tool is aimed at detecting JavaScript class emulation structures with respect to popular class/namespace emulation patterns introduced by major JavaScript books, blogs and authors.

The tool leverages AST tree generated by Closure Compiler and is able to find class emulation structures, namespaces and CommonsJS style modules with applying a light-weight data-flow analysis. 

# Usage
It requires you have at least JDK 7 installed on your machine with an Eclipse instance that has Maven plugin installed on it.

Alternatively you can resolve dependencies with `mvn install` to install JAR dependencies without the need for Maven plugin on Eclsipe.

This tool also comes with an Eclipse plugin, which itself is able to analyse JavaScript projects. But we will explore command-line mode to see how generate CSV outputs and console logs for experimental purpose.

Here is the list of switches you can pass to the CLI runner:

+ `-class_analysis`             : Advanceed static analysis to match function definitions with function calls (call-site)
+ `-function_analysis`          : Advanceed function analysis to match class definitions with initialization (call-site)
+ `-calculate_cyclomatic`       : Enable calculation of cyclomatic complexity
+ `-js`                         : The JavaScript filenames
+ `-directory_path`       	     : Directory path for javascript project
+ `-analyze-lbClasses`          : Analyze libraries to find class usage in them
+ `-builtin-libraries` 	    	 : List of libraries located somewhere on the system such as Node's built-in libraries i.e. Error or Util
+ `-disable_log`                : Enable logging mechanism
+ `-externs`          		    	 : List of externs files to use in the compilation.
+ `-libraries`                  : List of libraries to distinguish between production/test codes.
+ `-module-analysis`            : Enable module analysis for CommonJS or Closure Library style packaging
+ `-package-system`             : Select the package system including CommonJS and Closure Library
+ `-name`                       : Project name
+ `-output_csv`                 : Generate a CSV file containing analysis info
+ `-output_db`                  : Put analysis info into a Postgres DB
+ `-psqlServer`                 : Postgres password
+ `-psqlPort`                   : Postgres port
+ `-psqlDbName`                 : Postgres database name
+ `-psqlUser`                   : Postgres user
+ `-psqlPassword`               : Postgres password
+ `-version`                    : Project version
